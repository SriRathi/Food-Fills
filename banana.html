 <h2>HISTORY</h2><hr/>
<p style="font-size:20pt;color:white">A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry[1][2] – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.</p><br/>


<h2>PREPARATION</h2><hr/>
<p style="font-size:20pt;color:white">Molten chocolate cakes characteristically contain five ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar, chocolate, and flour. The butter and chocolate are melted together, while the eggs are either whisked with the sugar to form a thick paste, producing a denser pastry, or separated, with the white whipped into a meringue to provide more lift and a lighter result. A tablespoon of strong coffee is sometimes added to enhance the chocolate flavor. Vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon are additionally recommended in some cases to add extra flavor.

The cakes are typically baked in individual portions in ramekins, however, there are a number of creative variations in chocolate lava cakes or molten chocolate cakes such as preparing the cakes in a coffee or tea mug. The cake can also be prepared in a microwave oven instead of an oven in certain cases.</p><br>

<h2 >POPULARITY</h2><hr/>
<p style="font-size:20pt;color:white">In 2017, world production of bananas and plantains combined was 153 million tonnes, led by India and China with a combined total of 27% of global production.Other major producers were the Philippines, Colombia, Indonesia, Ecuador, and Brazil.

As reported for 2013, total world exports were 20 million tonnes of bananas and 859,000 tonnes of plantains.[84] Ecuador and the Philippines were the leading exporters with 5.4 and 3.3 million tonnes, respectively, and the Dominican Republic was the leading exporter of plantains with 210,350 tonnes.</p><br/>
