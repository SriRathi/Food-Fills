<h2>nutrition values</h2><hr/>
<p style="font-size:20pt;color:white">The nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw sweet potatoes are (5Trusted Source):

Calories: 86
Water: 77%
Protein: 1.6 grams
Carbs: 20.1 grams
Sugar: 4.2 grams
Fiber: 3 grams
Fat: 0.1 grams
Carbs:
A medium-sized sweet potato (boiled without the skin) contains 27 grams of carbs. The main components are starches, which make up 53% of the carb content.

Simple sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose, comprise 32% of the carb content (2Trusted Source).

Sweet potatoes have a medium to high glycemic index (GI), varying from 44–96. The GI is a measure of how fast your blood sugar levels rise after a meal (6).

Given the relatively high GI of sweet potatoes, large amounts in a single meal may be unsuitable for people with type 2 diabetes. Notably, boiling seems to be associated with lower GI values than baking, frying, or roasting (7Trusted Source).

Starch:
Starches are often split into three categories based on how well they’re digested. The starch proportions in sweet potatoes are as follows (8, 9Trusted Source, 10, 11Trusted Source):

Rapidly digested starch (80%). This starch is quickly broken down and absorbed, increasing the GI value.
Slowly digested starch (9%). This type breaks down more slowly and causes a smaller rise in blood sugar levels.
Resistant starch (11%). This one escapes digestion and acts like fiber, feeding your friendly gut bacteria. The amount of resistant starch may increase slightly by cooling the sweet potatoes after cooking.


Fiber:
Cooked sweet potatoes are relatively high in fiber, with a medium-sized sweet potato containing 3.8 grams.

The fibers are both soluble (15–23%) in the form of pectin, and insoluble (77–85%) in the form of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (12, 13Trusted Source, 14).

Soluble fibers, such as pectin, may increase fullness, decrease food intake, and reduce blood sugar spikes by slowing your digestion of sugars and starches (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source).

A high intake of insoluble fibers has been associated with health benefits, such as a reduced risk of diabetes and improved gut health (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).


Protein:
A medium-sized sweet potato holds 2 grams of protein, making it a poor protein source.

Sweet potatoes contain sporamins, unique proteins that account for more than 80% of their total protein content (14).

The sporamins are produced to facilitate healing whenever the plant is subjected to physical damage. Recent research suggests that they may have antioxidant properties (22Trusted Source).

Despite being relatively low in protein, sweet potatoes are an important source of this macronutrient in many developing countries (14, 23).

SUMMARY
Sweet potatoes are mainly composed of carbs. Most of the carbs come from starch, followed by fiber. This root vegetable is also relatively low in protein but still an important protein source in many developing countries.
Vitamins and minerals
Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta carotene, vitamin C, and potassium. The most abundant vitamins and minerals in this vegetable are (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source):

Pro-vitamin A. Sweet potatoes are rich in beta carotene, which your body can convert into vitamin A. Just 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of this vegetable provides the recommended daily amount of this vitamin.
Vitamin C. This antioxidant may decrease the duration of the common cold and improve skin health.
Potassium. Important for blood pressure control, this mineral may decrease your risk of heart disease.
Manganese. This trace mineral is important for growth, development, and metabolism.
Vitamin B6. This vitamin plays an important role in the conversion of food into energy.
Vitamin B5. Also known as pantothenic acid, this vitamin is found to some extent in nearly all foods.
Vitamin E. This powerful fat-soluble antioxidant may help protect your body against oxidative damage..</p><br>
